# Review on Internet Resource Consumption
## Examining material and energy usage of existing and envisioned internet architectures

The purpose of this repository is to collect articles and other media on estimates and claims of the environmental impacts through material and energy consumption of the internet. By creating such collection we facilitate their comparison with each other, possibly uncovering inconsistencies and untruths. The ultimate goal is the creation of a framework or translation of/between existing consumption metrices or, if the needed, create a new protocol/metric for the internet.
